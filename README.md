ActiveAndroidSamples
====================
Load from JSON assets file and do a One to Many join or Many to Many etc with Active Android. 

Also, shows a slightly faster way to load KeyValuePairs json rather than the usual methods.

Also, additions of writeAheadLogging and multi-threaded ActiveAndroid simultaneous inserts / deletes / database yields should be incoming soon.  Still testing.
